Overview
========

School Teachers, planning an education excursion to Canberra,
use the Book Canberra Excustion (BCE) system
to search and book education experiences.

Australian National Botanic Gardens (ANBG,
part of Parks Australia)
have facilities and programs to provide
educational experiences to school excursions.

The purpose of this exercise is to integrate BCE with
Parks Australia's systems, so that ANBG experiences
can be searched and booked from BCE by teachers
planning an school excustion in Canberra.

In the following diagram, the blue parts represent
user stories that are already supported
by the current systems.
The green parts represent new features
that are required to acomplish the integration.
